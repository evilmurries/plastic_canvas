# Plastic Canvas

## What is this thing?

The goal is to make a tool that is useful for miniature painters in the same
way that apps like battlescribe and quartermaster for gaming in the hobby. The end 
goal is to have a catalog of paint lines that can be tagged onto modeling and 
easy to generate recipe lists

## Why would I use this over the citadel app / some other thing?

This is mostly a passion project for me. If one person found it useful
that would be huge.
